# DataScience Assignments (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3)

This repository contains all the code and datasets used for completing the machine learning assignments:
- Task 1: Handling Missing Data
- Task 2: Replace Method
- Task 3: Linear Regression (5 Datasets)

## Task 1:
Performed missing data handling using fillna, dropna, interpolate, replace, and threshold methods.

## Task 2:
Updated discount values and converted rating categories into numerical values.

## Task 3:
Implemented Linear Regression models for 5 different datasets:
1. Advertising
2. Wine Quality
3. Salary Data
4. Housing Data
5. Diabetes (built-in sklearn)

Each notebook includes:
- preprocessing
- feature scaling
- Model training
- Prediction table
- Evaluation metrics
